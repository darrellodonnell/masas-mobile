======================

MASTER REPO: https://github.com/darrellodonnell/masas-mobile-ios-build.git

iOS build project for MASAS Mobile

NOTE: the ./www folder is NOT maintained in the git repo for this iOS Build. It 
is ignored and needs to be maintained in the main git repo, which is located at
	https://github.com/darrellodonnell/masas-mobile.git
	

Assuming you check out the masas-mobile repo to ./masas-mobile-git then the script
for refreshing the ./www folder (./refreshWWW.sh) won't need any modification. 
If you have made changes to the foldername, adjust the ./refreshWWW.sh shell 
script accordingly.
